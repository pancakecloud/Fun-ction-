              At the heart of my practice is an exploration of how design can
              act as a catalyst for curiosity and critical engagement with
              topics like human perception, memory, culture, and identity.
              Speculative and interactive design play a key role in transforming
              abstract ideas into tangible, participatory experiences—whether
              through immersive installations, coding, or creative storytelling.
            </p>
            <p class="PD">
              This writing will explore how I bring these ideas to life,
              focusing on the interplay of functionality and speculation in my
              works, Piece of Home and From the Other Side. These projects
              reflect my ongoing exploration of how design can serve as a space
              for curiosity, dialogue and reflection, examining our relationship
              with symbols and societal narratives. This writing focuses on the
              themes I explore in my practice, matters such as audience are
              addressed in my Unit 6 portfolio.
            </p>
            <p class="PD">
              A central pillar of my approach is engaging the audience through
              interaction—turning them into active participants who experience
              and reshape the work. Through these projects, I explore how design
              can inspire new ways of perceiving and engaging with the world
              around us, offering fresh opportunities for connection and
              understanding.

            <p class="Utility">
              Historically, design has been closely tied to meeting capitalist
              demands (Woodham, 1997). While some progress has been made,
              graphic design is still often viewed primarily as a
              problem-solving tool for consumer society. Cameron Tonkinwise
              (Degl’Innocenti, 2021) argues for a broader perspective—one that
              considers the ethical and systemic implications of design beyond
              its immediate functionality.
            </p>
            <p class="Perception">
              I believe multi-sensory design offers a pathway to address these
              concerns. Here I draw from Speculative design’s foundational
              mindset: an openness to new ideas and a willingness to experiment.
              This aligns with my focus on interactivity and multi-sensory
              design, where each project becomes an opportunity to push
              boundaries. Whether through interactive coding, data
              visualization, or reinterpreting historical narratives, I aim to
              create work that resonates on the visual, haptic and contextual
              level. I resonate with the philosophy of IDEO, which emphasizes
              the importance of designers having a distinctive approach rather
              than a defined style (Tim Brown, 2024). This flexibility allows me
              to explore and express ideas across various mediums, cementing my
              identity as a multidisciplinary designer.
            </p>
            <p class="PD">
              Engaging multiple senses with purpose is central to my practice,
              as I believe it creates deeper connections and makes design more
              akin to natural human experiences. Influences like Jinsop Lee’s
              talk Design for the 5 Senses (TED, 2024), which highlights the
              importance of engaging multiple senses in design to create richer,
              more stimulating experiences, have shaped my thinking about how
              people could interact with and perceive design. Similarly,
              FIELD.IO’s experimental data visualizations combine art,
              technology, and storytelling to convey complex information in
              visually compelling ways.
            </p>
            <p class="Perception">
              An interesting example of this is their project Sensing Spaces for
              Google (Fig1.1). The project recorded visitors' neuroaesthetic
              responses to different interiors to explore the question: Can we
              measure the impact of design on our wellbeing? (Field.io, 2019)
              The project not only produced a compelling visual representation
              of the data collected but also prompted the participants to
              rethink the impact of their surroundings on themselves. The
              experience proved to people that design matters and affects you.
              "It's scientific proof that design is important." said Ivy Ross
              (Hitti , 2019) This project made me realise how design can be
              strategically used to raise points while engaging the audience and
              also how the data itself can feed our design. I am inspired to
              further explore how interactivity and data can work together to
              communicate diverse narratives effectively. These ideas converge
              in projects like Piece of Home, where interactivity acts as both a
              narrative tool to highlight the positive impact of immigration in
              London and a means to visualise cultural diversity.

              My project Piece of Home (Fig 1.2) reimagines London’s culinary
              landscape as a reactive map. Living in London has taught me that
              the traditional British stereotype often conceals the true
              diversity of life here. To capture this idea, the project uses the
              metaphor of british food plates flipping to reveal immigrant
              cuisines, symbolizing how appearances can be deceiving. This
              flipping action, triggered by the viewer’s movement, mirrors the
              role of human migration in shaping modern London. Speculative
              design has allowed me to envision displays that actively engage
              their environment and audience. I incorporated interactivity, as
              it is more effective in capturing attention and fostering a
              personal connection to the stories of immigration and its impact.

              I use food as a relatable yet profound symbol to showcase how
              immigration reshapes culture. This recontextualisation invites

              reconsider their own preconceptions about cultural exchange.

              This project highlights the relational aspect of my work. I aim to

              visceral response and invite further contemplation on topics that
              might get normalised in the viewers’ busy life. For instance the
              gradual flipping of British dishes into immigrant cuisines prompts
              a reflective pause, inviting audiences to consider the layers of
              cultural influence in everyday experiences as casual as eating.

              Phenomenology, a concept introduced by Edmund Husserl, deeply
              resonates with my practice of intertwining perception and
              interactivity (Husserl, 1913). In Piece of Home, viewer
              interaction transforms abstract knowledge into a lived experience.

              The reactive installation goes beyond documenting cultural
              narratives, making them physically and emotionally perceptible and
              aligning with phenomenology’s focus on the connection between
              consciousness and environment. Cartesian thinking prioritises
              objective understanding, but I find phenomenology more compelling
              for its ability to highlight the interconnectedness between
              individuals and their environments. By acknowledging how our
              senses and emotions shape interpretation, phenomenology shifts the
              focus from meaning as an intrinsic property to meaning as a
              dynamic relationship with consciousness (Heidegger, 1962).

              reinterpretation of everyday concepts. This lens guides projects
              that aim to encourage viewers to see common moments—like a simple
              airport poster about the connection between food and culture—in
              unexpected ways by disrupting reality. Likewise, systems

              In the TED Talk Design for the 5 Senses, Jinsop Lee’s example of a

              reinterpretation of functionality. Not only does the clock fulfill

              approach to design, where I consistently ask: Does my work serve a
              purpose? I believe that design should either introduce a new
              purpose or transform an existing one, creating experiences that
              engage and connect with audiences on a deeper intellectual level
              by expressing themes unconventionally.

              Naoto Fukasa is a designer who’s approach to design resonates with
              mine. He looks into the relation between things, people and the
              environment. These ideas manifest in many ways in his work. His
              Juice Skin (Fig. 2) tetra-pack packaging showcases functionality
              in a simple yet profound way rooted in his ideology of ‘no
              thought’. He says, “When you drink water, for example, you don’t
              think about the glass. You drink from it” (InLee, 2015). By
              mimicking the texture and appearance of the fruit it contains, the
              design creates an intuitive connection between product and user,
              blending practicality with sensory engagement. These juice boxes
              show us how versatile a simple object can be without changing its
              geometry while also making the user experience better.

              simple topics that might have strong existing notions. For
              example, the interactivity within my projects, like the Piece of
              Home installation, allows the audience to experience the design
              through active participation, something unexpected from the
              airport poster. The function of the design is as much about the
              conversation it generates as the physical interaction it invites.
              It becomes a medium through which people can explore complex
              narratives of identity, culture, and migration.

              While I strive for usefulness in my work, speculative design has
              taught me that utility can take many forms. Speculative Design
              invites us to explore possibilities, futures, and "what-ifs"
              (Neeley, 2024). But how is that useful to us now? Its value lies
              in its ability to inspire debate and critical thinking. While
              design is often seen as a tool for problem-solving, it is equally
              powerful as a medium for posing questions that challenge
              assumptions and reveal hidden realities (TEDxTalks, 2023).
              Designers like Dunne & Raby also emphasize this approach, arguing
              that design's purpose extends beyond providing solutions to
              sparking dialogue and encouraging reflection (Dunne and Raby,
              2013).

              For example, as a response to the brief asking us to create a

              represent a place or concept differently depending on the viewer's
              perspective. My project, ‘From the Other Side’ (Fig 3.1),
              challenges the viewer to consider how symbols, like flags, could
              have multiple interpretations based on their vantage
              point—prompting reflection on how meaning is constructed, if
              something as simple as the direction you look from can change this
              meaning.

              This exploration extended further by speculating on the needs of a
              nascent civilization. The concept evolved to include a numeral
              system and a timekeeper (Fig 3.2) inspired by lunar diurnal
              rhythms, questioning how these elements could redefine practical
              and symbolic tools in a new context. These designs blur the lines
              between representation and depiction, questioning the role of
              flags. They challenge viewers to rethink flags as symbols,

              Ultimately, speculative design provides a framework to imagine
              alternative futures and provoke critical thought, encouraging us
              to reconsider how design shapes and reflects human experiences.

              Apple’s ‘Knowledge Navigator’ video (Fig 3.3), released in 1987
              (Youtube, 2012), envisioned a future where technologies like the
              internet, tablets, and voice recognition, which were not yet
              commonplace, would become central to our daily lives. While such
              concepts seemed far-off, the video acted as a speculative piece
              that not only imagined these innovations but also hinted at the
              experiences they could create.

              Today, many of these technologies are ubiquitous, demonstrating
              how speculative design can inspire real-world advancements. More
              than a fictional vision, the video acted as a catalyst for these
              emerging ideas, influencing the design of the devices we now rely
              on. It shows how speculative design can serve as an aspirational
              end goal.

              Similarly, the 2012 Google Glass "One Day" walkthrough video (Fig
              3.4) (MarioCon, 2012) introduced the vision of a world seamlessly
              integrated with augmented reality. It showcased glasses equipped
              with a camera that could assist with tasks in real time and share
              your perspective as it happened. In a TED Talk (TED, 2013), Sergey
              Brin described the glasses as a tool for accessing information on
              demand while freeing your hands, eyes, and ears from dependence on

              Since then, numerous AR glasses and headsets have been released,
              including recent advancements like Apple’s Vision Pro. These
              devices continue to push the boundaries of augmented and mixed
              reality, offering immersive experiences. However, most remain
              tethered to smartphones, displaying information primarily sent
              through mobile devices. A pivotal missing element has been the
              ability to analyze the world in real time using a camera—something
              Google began addressing with the launch of Google Lens in 2017.
              Identifying text to translate or copy. Detecting objects and
              finding related matches. Accessing directions and information
              displayed directly in front of our eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="Utility">
              The Vision Pro demonstrates the industry's ambition to create
              highly capable AR devices, but the journey to fully autonomous,
              real-time AR glasses remains ongoing. Google Lens represents a
              significant step toward realizing this vision, offering
              foundational technologies that could pave the way for the next
              generation of AR products. The original Google Glass concept video
              not only inspired the public to imagine a new way of navigating
              the world but also set an aspirational benchmark for the industry,
              influencing the development of products. Without this foundational
              vision, the advancements we see today might not have been
              possible. Navigation existed back then but Google aimed to
              discover new ways of navigating, which I do with Flags in From the
              Other Side as it speculates how they might adapt in form and
              meaning.

              As mentioned earlier, while speculative design pushes the
              boundaries of what design can represent, I also value
              functionality—ensuring that a design serves a meaningful purpose
              within its context. When combined with speculative design,
              functionality in my work extends beyond practicality to create
              experiences that resonate on both a personal and emotional level.
              By focusing on how my work interacts with its audience—through
              tactile interaction, visual exploration, or conceptual
              provocation—I ensure that they serve as both functional objects
              and vehicles for deeper thought.

            <p class="Concept">
              Speculative design's true utility lies in its capacity to broaden
              perspectives, challenge the status quo, and inspire new ways of
              thinking about the past, present and future.

            <p class="Concept">
              Putting together this report has helped me understand that I
              comprehend design better when people speak about their work. It is
              through listening to others and reflecting on my own practice that
              I’ve come to realise that I see projects as opportunities to
              learn—both about the themes they explore and the skills required
              to execute them.
            </p>
            <p class="Utility">
              Design has the potential to inspire new ways of thinking. By
              embracing speculative approaches and multi-sensory experiences, I
              aim to create work that goes beyond functionality, fostering
              connections with themes and sparking dialogue about reimagining
              symbols like flags. Piece of Home exemplifies this, using
              interactivity to make the concept of immigration tangible and
              meaningful.

            <p class="Concept">
              Reflecting on the past year, I’ve transitioned from viewing design
              as transactional, to recognising its ability to inspire
              reflection, foster curiosity, and imagine alternative futures. My
              current practice blends these speculative frameworks with a
              commitment to functionality, ensuring that my specified project
              serves as either a tool to present information while encouraging a
              conversation about the impacts of immigration responding to
              functionality or a conversation about what flags represent
              responding to speculation.
